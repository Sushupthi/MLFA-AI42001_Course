Welcome to the MLFA AI42001 Projects Repository! This GitHub repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the MLFA AI42001 course. These projects showcase various machine learning techniques and algorithms implemented in Python.

Project List:

1. Sentiment Classification:

Description: This project focuses on sentiment analysis using machine learning. It involves training models to classify text data as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed.


2. Decision Tree:

Description: This project explores decision tree algorithms for classification and regression tasks. It includes building decision tree models, handling missing values, pruning techniques, and interpreting the decision tree results.



3. Spam/Ham Classification:

Description: This project addresses the problem of spam detection in emails. It involves building a classifier to distinguish between legitimate (ham) and spam emails, improving email filtering systems.


4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Description: This project focuses on the KNN algorithm, a popular instance-based learning method. It includes implementing KNN for classification and regression tasks, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating the model's performance.
